Que: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

Ans:
	1. When sharing my work with others which later can collaboratively modified.
	2. When teaming up with certain people who share common interests.
	3. When improving my work with the help of others.
	4. When merging some part of code of some feature that someone worked elsewhere
	with my code that is altogether different.

Que: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Ans: When we pull a branch, the parent commit of remote branch is joined to the
tip of the local branch and the tip of the local branch is updated to the tip of
the remote branch (in local repository).
We pull a branch from a remote repository that we may be interested to
contribute. Since we pull remote branches that we wish to continue working with,
if git is automated to stay up-to-date with a remote repository, the chances are
that git may pull all branches and update our local repository with all unwanted
branches that we may not use or work with. That way, manually pulling the changes
is very reasonable.

Que: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

Ans: Fork is used to copy an entire repository from one github user's account 
to another user's github account. Clone is used to copy a git repository from a
remote location to a local computer or to make more than one copy in local
computer. Branch is used to name a commit that branches out from the parent
branch. The name given to the new branch is updated always to point to the tip of
the branch everytime the branch gets a new commit.

I use fork when I need to experiment on someone else's repository but don't have
permission to push my local changes to the remote repository.
I use clone when I have to copy a remote repository to my local computer or to
make different copies of a local repository.
I use branching when I have to work on a new featrue or for I18N that I'm not yet
sure if it works fine or fits with my production line code properly.
