Que: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

Ans:
	1. When sharing my work with others which later can collaboratively modified.
	2. When teaming up with certain people who share common interests.
	3. When improving my work with the help of others.
	4. When merging some part of code of some feature that someone worked elsewhere
	with my code that is altogether different.

Que: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Ans: When we pull a branch, the parent commit of remote branch is joined to the
tip of the local branch and the tip of the local branch is updated to the tip of
the remote branch (in local repository).
We pull a branch from a remote repository that we may be interested to
contribute. Since we pull remote branches that we wish to continue working with,
if git is automated to stay up-to-date with a remote repository, the chances are
that git may pull all branches and update our local repository with all unwanted
branches that we may not use or work with. That way, manually pulling the changes
is very reasonable.
